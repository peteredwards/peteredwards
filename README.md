My name is Peter Edwards and I currently work at the University of Leeds as an Application Support Analyst.

My main area of responsibility is the maintenance of digital repositories for the Library and the Research Data Team which currently use [EPrints](https://www.eprints.org).

I'm also involved in other projects in the Research Services Team in Application Support.
